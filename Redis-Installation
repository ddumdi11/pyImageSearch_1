Configuring and installing Redis for our Keras REST API

Redis is very easy to install. Below you’ll find the commands to download, extract, and install Redis on your system:
→ Launch Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab

$ wget http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz
$ cd redis-stable
$ make
$ sudo make install

To start the Redis server, use the following command:
→ Launch Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab
A scalable Keras + deep learning REST API Outline
$ redis-server

Leave this terminal open to keep the Redis data store running.

In another terminal, you can validate Redis is up and running:
→ Launch Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab

$ redis-cli ping
